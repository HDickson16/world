	  <h1>My love for Art</h1>
	  <p><img src="../gallery_images/art3.jpg" width="250" height="250" alt="picture of a man holding a microphone"/><span style="font-family: neonoir, 'sans-serif;'; font-size: 20pt;">My favorite thing in the world is art.</span> Ever since I was a little girl I've had a dream to become a famous and well known Artist. Art is something that makes me very happy and relaxed, I also believe that art is always something you yourself should be proud of because you created it.</p>
		<p>My art career started with simple coloring books and stick figures like any other child. But soon I started to really get a kick out of drawing people, animals, landscapes, portraits, etc. I'm 16 now and I still love to create art, mostly I use digital rather than traditional because I find digital more interesting. I admire creating anything my heart desires, it gives me the feeling of freedom.</p>
	  <p>Even if I don't become a famous artist I will still create beautiful pieces of art till my last breathe because it truly is the one thing that keeps me happy.</p>

	  <h1>Music</h1>
	  <p><img src="../images/record.jpg" alt="A picture of a pink record player" width="250" height="250" class="floatLeft"/><span style="font-family: neonoir, 'sans-serif;'; font-size: 20pt;">My favorite types of music goes from late 70's to late 90's.</span> From Elton John to the band Gorillaz, my love for music keeps growing. My whole life I have been listening to a variety of different types of music, to country to rap. But the type of music I really love to listen to, epecially for the past few years have been between the 70's and 90's rock.</p>
	  <p>Some of my favorite musicians are Elton John, The Beatles, Queen, Micheal Jackson, Gorillaz, Blur, Rolling Stones, Edision Lighthouse, Prince, etc. </p>
	  <p>Other than art, music is another one of my favorite things I admire. Listening to the different meanings of the lyrics, relaxing to rhythms and beats of the song, music can mean different things to certain types of people, everyone has their own taste, I especially have my own. I love to collect records of my favorite musicians, makes me feel cool. Right now I possibly have over 30 records and I'm not gonna stop collecting anytime soon.</p></article>

	  <h1>A little more about me</h1>
	  <p><img src="../images/me.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="250"/><span style="font-family: neonoir, 'sans-serif;'; font-size: 20pt;">I am anything but normal.</span>I have a love for multiple things in this world. I could probably go on and on about the thousands of things I'm intersted in. But I'll keep it short, I love thrift shopping, drawing, hanging out with my friends, spending time with family. Family to me is something close to my heart because they are always my main supporters. I have the motivation to keep following what I love because of them. I keep drawing and working hard so I can achieve my dream of becoming a well known artist and something more. I want to change the world with the art I create, impact and make it better. </p>
